# Portfolio README
This is a small portfolio of diagrams I have made using [diagrams.net / draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/). Each diagram can be viewed as a PNG image, or opened in the [draw.io app](https://app.diagrams.net) to view and edit as a Scalable Vector Graphic, as each image was exported containing the XML data of its diagram.

## Notes:
1) This is a small selection of what I have created. I would be happy to show and discuss anything mentioned in my Cover Letter or CV.
2) The Class Diagram is not the final version I made, and therefore possibly incomplete. I only had this early version saved on my computer; the full version was submitted with my coursework, but I no longer have it.
